## Privacy
By being able to see the contract's balance of Buttcoin, it's possible to figure out which address deposited which amount. However, Buttcoin itself is a private coin so a user could technically move that around to multiple wallets and go from there. Really the biggest issue I've seen for privacy is that all the different wallets end up being linked to the same central exchange account's memo.
I think the user's balance and what they spend on should be private, but an organisation should be quite public. Gotta get the balance right.
